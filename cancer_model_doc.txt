2. **Model Training**: Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV with cross-validation
4. **Pipeline Architecture**: Combining preprocessing and modeling
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models on unseen test data
6. **Visualization**: Actual vs Predicted plots for model analysis
7. **Best Practices**: Correct vs Incorrect approaches side-by-side

## 📊 Project Details: Breast Cancer Regression (cancer.ipynb)

### Dataset
- **Source**: scikit-learn breast cancer dataset
- **Samples**: 569
- **Features**: 30 medical measurements

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Data Loading & Splitting
```python
# Load dataset and split 80/20
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2)
```

#### Step 2: Wrong Approach (Educational)
Shows what happens when you train and test on the same data:
- ✗ Trains on entire dataset (569 samples)
- ✗ Tests on entire dataset (569 samples)
- ✗ Artificially high metrics (overfitting)

**Result**: R² Score: ~0.99 (unrealistic!)

#### Step 3: Correct Approach
Proper train-test methodology:
- ✓ Train model on 80% of data
- ✓ Evaluate on unseen 20% of data
- ✓ Realistic performance metrics

**Result**: More honest model assessment

#### Step 4: Pipeline Creation
```python
pipe = Pipeline([
    ("scale", StandardScaler()),      # Normalize features
    ("model", KNeighborsRegressor())  # KNN model
])
```

#### Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
Uses GridSearchCV with 3-fold cross-validation:
```python
GridSearchCV(
    estimator=pipe,
    param_grid={'model__n_neighbors': [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]},
    cv=3
)
```
- Tests different k values (1 to 9)
- Cross-validation prevents overfitting
- Finds optimal n_neighbors on training data

#### Step 6: Model Comparison
Compares two algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**: Assumes linear relationship
- **KNN (GridSearchCV)**: Non-parametric, flexible

#### Step 7: Visualization
4-panel plot showing:
1. Linear Regression - Training Performance
2. Linear Regression - Testing Performance
3. KNN - Training Performance
4. KNN - Testing Performance

## 📈 Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **R² Score** | 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot) | How well model explains variance (0-1, higher is better) |
| **RMSE** | √(MSE) | Root Mean Squared Error (same units as target) |
| **MAE** | Mean(\|actual - predicted\|) | Average absolute error (interpretable) |

### Good Model Signs:
- ✓ Training R² ≈ Testing R² (no overfitting)
- ✓ Testing metrics lower than training (normal)
- ✓ Predictions close to diagonal line (Actual vs Predicted plot)

### Bad Model Signs:
- ✗ Training R² >> Testing R² (severe overfitting)
- ✗ Negative R² on test data (very poor)
- ✗ Large scatter around diagonal line

## 🔍 Important Concepts

### Train-Test Split
Prevents the model from memorizing training data:
```python
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
- **Why**: Models perform better on data they've seen
- **Solution**: Test on unseen data
- **Trade-off**: Less training data but honest evaluation

### GridSearchCV
Automated hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation:
- Tries multiple hyperparameter combinations
- Uses cross-validation (divides training data further)
- Returns best parameters found on training data
- Prevents tuning overfitting

### Pipeline
Combines preprocessing and modeling:
```python
Pipeline([
    ("scale", StandardScaler()),      # Preprocessing step
    ("model", KNeighborsRegressor())  # Modeling step
])
```
- Ensures preprocessing applied consistently
- Prevents data leakage during cross-validation
